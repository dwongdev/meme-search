New Pro Version 1.0 Release!

The Pro version of Meme Search introduces the following new features:

1.  **Auto-Generate Meme Descriptions**

    Target specific memes for auto-description generation (instead of applying to your entire directory).

2.  **Manual Meme Description Editing**

    Edit or add descriptions manually for better search results, no need to wait for auto-generation if you don't want to.

3.  **Tags**

    Create, edit, and assign tags to memes for better organization and search filtering.

4.  **Faster Vector Search**

    Powered by Postgres and pgvector, enjoy faster keyword and vector searches with streamlined database transactions.

5.  **Keyword Search**

    Pro adds traditional keyword search in addition to semantic/vector search.

6.  **Directory Paths**

    Organize your memes across multiple subdirectoriesâ€”no need to store everything in one folder.

7.  **New Organizational Tools**

    Filter by tags, directory paths, and description embeddings, plus toggle between keyword and vector search for more control.
